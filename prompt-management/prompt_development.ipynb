    "# Generative AI Dynamic Prompt Management \n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI applications have revolutionized how we interact with technology, but their effectiveness hinges on a critical factor: up-to-date context. In this tutorial, we'll explore why delivering current and relevant information is crucial for AI models to produce accurate, useful, and timely outputs. We'll examine how missing or outdated context can lead to irrelevant or incorrect responses, and diminished user trust. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial focuses on using Tecton to create and manage context enriched generative AI prompts. Tecton provides feature pipelines that deliver the required data freshness for batch, streaming and real-time data flows at scale. In this tutorial we start with an environment where multiple feature pipelines are already deployed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- restaurant features, \n",
    "- user's profile features\n",
    "- user's last 100 restaurants visited\n",
    "- user's ratings by cuisine\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial you will:\n",
    "- create a simple AI chat function to simulate a gen AI application\n",
    "- design a prompt for a restaurant recommendation app\n",
    "- refine the prompt by adding context from real-time features \n",
    "- create a new version of the prompt and setup A/B testing\n",
    "- visualize lineage of each prompt version \n",
