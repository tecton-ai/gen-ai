    "This is an example of how an LLM can make use of feature views as data retrieval tools. At development time, you provide the set of feature views that the LLM agent is allowed to call. The LLM uses the feature view's description field to determine what tools are relevant for answering the user question. It  makes the corresponing feature retrieval call(s) using the Tecton entity keys provided in the context of the call.\n"
